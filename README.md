CompArch projects


pa0: Euclid Euler --> Finding the Mersenne prime numbers corresponding to a perfect number. Practice compiling, running, debugging, and testing programs using the Linux command line.

pa1: Writing algorithms, using recursions, arrays, and pointers in C. It also reviews the use of data structures in C, such as efficient sorting algorithms, multidimensional arrays, and recursion. 

pa2: Further practice using header files to organize your source code, using and building data structures, and recursive function calls. Graph algorithms, hashing algorithms, and other data structures are analyzed and implemented. 

pa3: Learn how data is represented in computers and the properties and limitations of data types. Also, I experimented with how computers carry out mathematical operations on data representations. Such knowledge lends insight into how the electronic hardware of computers performs calculations, and allows you to gain intuition about the relative costs of different operations.

pa4: Shows how all programs written in programming languages like C are compiled down to assembly instructions that run as machine code on hardware. Reversed engineered short lines of assembly code to diffuse a binary bomb. Helped gain familiarity with the Linux environment and debugging tools such as gdb and objdump.

pa5: I experiment with different cache designs, and see how they impact the ability for caches to create an illusion of fast access from the CPU to main memory.

pa6: Helped me gain familiarity with digital logic circuits that underpin all computers. I also experimented with basic building blocks of computers, including comparators, multiplexers, and adders. This assignment also serves as a programming exercise that revisits some of the earlier problems solved in class, including working with integer arithmetic and how caches work.
